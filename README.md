This is a couple of helpers I wrote to abstract
an asynchronous programming by loosely following
the Promise / Future model.

See the test file for different use cases.


### How do I get set up? ###

This project was tested with version 3.10.0. It uses .NET 4.5 features.
You want to modify the Makefile changing the variables MONOPATH and NUNITCONSOLE and point to the Mono runtime and nunit-console respectively. 

Just run make and it will build and test the DLL. The Makefile is fairly simple so any make will do.


### Who do I talk to? ###
